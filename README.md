You should have received a `.rai_profile` file by email.
Put that file in `~/.rai_profile` (Linux/macOS) or `%HOME%/.rai_profile` (Windows).
Your `.rai_profile` should look something like this (indented with tabs!)

    profile:
        firstname: <your-given-name>
        lastname: <your-surname>
        username: <your-username>
        email: <your-institution-email>
        access_key: <your-access-key>
        secret_key: <your-secret-key>
        affiliation: <your-affiliation>
